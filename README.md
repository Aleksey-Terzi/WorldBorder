WorldBorder
===========

A Bukkit plugin to provide borders for your worlds, to limit their sizes.

Description
===========

This plugin is intended to be able to supersede BorderGuard Lite and rBorder in functionality, and to impact server performance as little as possible, hopefully very close to being on par with rBorder. And, like rBorder, the source is available. Configuration and border setup is done using commands in-game or through the server console. All commands support GroupManager and Permissions plugin, so you can use either to set up command permissions.
